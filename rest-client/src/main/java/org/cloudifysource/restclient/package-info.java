 * <p>
 * 
 * This package provides the classes necessary to communicate with the REST server.
 * <br>
 * The main class in this package is {@link org.cloudifysource.restclient.GSRestClient}.
 * It communicates with the REST server using standard HTTP commands (i.e. Get, Post, Delete).
 * Requests are parsed using jackson mapper to map json text to objects and vice versa.
 * <br>
 * The client receives relative URLs and builds the full URL address based on the URL
 * provided by the user initially, through the "connect" command.
 * <br>
 * (For example, if the user connects to http://localhost:8100 and executes GET
 * with "service/services" - the GSRestClient will issue a GET request to:
 * "http://localhost:8100/service/services").
 * <br>
 * POST and DELETE can also receive a map of parameters which will be embedded in
 * the HTTP request sent to the server.
 * <br>
 * To send a file to the rest server use postFile.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Exception handling is performed with these classes:
 * <br>
 * {@link org.cloudifysource.restclient.exceptions.RestException}
 * <br>
 * {@link org.cloudifysource.restclient.exceptions.ErrorStatusException}
 * <p>
 * 
 * {@link org.cloudifysource.restclient.RestSSLSocketFactory} - Handles secure communication with the REST server.
